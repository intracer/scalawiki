/** Process-wide gate and registry for "outbound wiki write" operations (page
  * edits, file uploads).
  *
  * The WLX statistics engine fans out dozens of `bot.page(...).edit(...)` calls
  * whose `Future` results are simply discarded by their callers ("fire and
  * forget"). Three things then go wrong silently:
  *   - all the edits are launched at once; with only two connections to the host
  *     and Pekko's default `max-open-requests = 32`, the surplus requests fail
  *     immediately with `BufferOverflowException` and those reports never
  *     publish;
  *   - a failed edit is never observed, so nothing says a report didn't publish;
  *   - `main` has no idea when the writes are actually finished, so the process
  *     either exits too early (killing the in-flight edits) or never exits.
  *
  * Once [[enable]] has been called, [[submit]] runs each write through a small
  * concurrency gate, logs any failure together with its throwable, and
  * [[awaitQuiescence]] blocks until the queue has drained. Disabled by default,
  * so library and test users keep the old unthrottled fire-and-forget behaviour.
