/** WLM UA 2026 rule 7.3.4: a monument photo gets an extra `bonus` points if every
  * photo of that monument already known before the contest started is dated earlier
  * than `beforeDate` (i.e. the monument has only "old" pictures).
  *
  * A photo's date is taken from EXIF metadata (DateTimeOriginal) when available,
  * otherwise from the upload/revision timestamp. If any known photo has no date at
  * all we cannot assert that "all photos are old", so no bonus is given.
  *
  * "Already known" only covers prior-year contest uploads (see
  * [[Rater.oldImagesByMonumentId]]); photos on Commons or Wikipedia that were
  * never entered into the contest are not considered, so a monument that was
  * photographed outside the contest after `beforeDate` may still get the bonus.
